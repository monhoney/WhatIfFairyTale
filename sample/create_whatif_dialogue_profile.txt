The following is a play script for the story The Wizard of OZ. I wish critics would change the dialogue in the play script appropriately.
    ===================================
    [play script]
      The Wizard of Oz admits he is just a normal man and provides the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion with tokens that represent their desired traits.
      Scarecrow : Dear Wizard, will I finally possess a brain?
      Wizard of Oz : Take this token. It symbolizes the wisdom you have always desired.
