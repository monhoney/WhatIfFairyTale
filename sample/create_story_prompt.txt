Divide the story of The Wizard of OZ into 10 scenes, and compose each scene with descriptions of the situations, the personas of the characters involved, and a few dialogues they exchange. Please provide a brief description of the situation in 2 to 3 sentences. I would like it to be output in JSON format.
The JSON format must have the following fields:

{
  "scenes": [
    {
      "scene_number": 1,
      "situation": "blahblah",
      "characters": [
        {
          "name": "blahblah",
          "persona": "blahblah",
          "dialogue": "blahblah",
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "scene_number": 2,
      "situation": "blahblah",
      "characters": [
        {
          "name": "blahblah",
          "persona": "blahblah",
          "dialogue": "blahblah",
        },
        {
          "name": "blahblah",
          "persona": "blahblah",
          "dialogue": "blahblah",
        }
      ],
      ...
    }]}
