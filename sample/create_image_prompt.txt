Draw a picture to explain the following situation
=========================
Dorothy says her goodbyes and returns to Kansas, cherishing the lessons learned in Oz.
=========================
In the picture, the character Dorothy has a "Curious and determined" persona and says "Farewell, Scarecrow, Tin Man, Lion, and Wizard. Thank you for everything!"
In the picture, the character Scarecrow has a "Inanimate but longing for a brain" persona and says "Take care, Dorothy. May you always remember, intelligence is within you."
I would like you to draw page number 10 at the bottom of the picture. Please draw it in a fairy-tale style.
